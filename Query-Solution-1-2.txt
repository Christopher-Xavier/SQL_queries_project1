Question 2 : Now we need to know how the length of rental duration of these family-friendly movies compares to the duration that all movies are rented for. Can you provide a table with the movie titles 
and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all 
categories? Make sure to also indicate the category that these family-friendly movies fall into.



/*Query 2/*
SELECT f.title, c.name, f.rental_duration, NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY f.rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
FROM film_category fc
JOIN category c
ON c.category_id = fc.category_id
JOIN film f
ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
WHERE c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
ORDER BY 3
